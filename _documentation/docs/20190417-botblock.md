As your bot application grows, you want to expose your bot to as many bot list and application
websites as you can.

However, finding the correct endpoint for other bot lists are a hassle.  
BotBlock aims to solve this by providing a single POST endpoint to update your counts to all bot
lists all at once.

## Setup
You will need your `Discord Apps Marketplace Token`, found by clicking the `Configure` button under your bot page.

## Discord.js and Eris
You will need to install `node-fetch` to POST your count to the proprietary API

```bash
npm install --save node-fetch
```
or 
```bash
yarn add node-fetch
```

```js
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

const updateGuildCounts = () => {
  console.log('Posting bot counts');
  fetch('https://botblock.org/api/count', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      'server_count': client.guilds.length,
      'bot_id': client.user.id,
      'discordapps.dev': '// THE TOKEN FROM THE CONFIGURE PAGE //',
    })
  })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(({success, failure}) => {
      console.log('Success: ' + Object.keys(success).join(', '));
      console.log('Failure: ' + Object.keys(failure).join(', '));
    });
};

client.once('ready', () => {
  updateGuildCounts();
  setInterval(updateGuildCounts, 1.8e6); // Every 30 minutes
})
```

## Other Languages
The community has made free and open source libraries to help you post counts to the proprietary
service. [You can find them, and other bot lists at the BotBlock.org documentation](https://botblock.org/api/docs)
