GitHub releases seems like the best place to write a blog.  
Expect a message every day or two.

Today:
- Made a new home page
- Added a blog link that just links to this page
- Added a YouTube video to the background of the [slider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrCLBuf0Yec)
- Split the footer in two

Also:
- Attempted to use Redux to load all bots for SSR (to share state), but just got recursive errors
