The terrible reign of Webpack is over - with `parcel`, future Terminal.ink Bot List builds will be accelerated into the future, with less configuration files.

This means more can be delivered to the end user in a timely manner.

## Changes
```diff
+ Bumped ls version to `ls14`
+ Made YouTube video in home screen use the `nocookies` site
+ Removed `create-react-app` and the bodged together SSR solution
+ Added `parcel` instead
- Removed YeoJin from LOONA 1/3
```

_There's actually no visible difference between ls13 and ls14, they're all to do with how it's built_

### CSS Modules
_The CSS modules are now no longer precariously handled between the black box CRA and the SSR server_
